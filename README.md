# `Generative-AI`

Before answering the question ` What is the Generative AI ? `. let us first answer the following question 

Q `What do the following terms really mean?`
  1) Artificial Intelligence
  2) Machine Learning
  3) Deep Learning
  4) Natural Language Processing

`Artificial Intelligence` : Artificial Intelligence is like giving a brains to machines ( computers ) so that the computers can do tasks & think themselves. In other words it is a process of teaching a computers to do a tasks and think like the humans do 

`Machine Learning` : ML is subset of the Artificial Intelligence. The main focus of the ML is to devolope a algorithms and statistical models which enables computers to do tasks and think. These ML algorithms and models learn form the data, identify pattern and makes a decision with minimum human intervention

Generative AI refers to `Deep learning models` that can generate the high quality `Texts`, `Images`, and other content based on the `data` that they are trained on.
